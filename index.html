                <dd>Based on my understanding of cryptography, yes.
                However, I am not an expert in cryptography and can make no guarantee and thus can make no promises.</dd>

                <dt>What is salt?</dt>
                <dd>A salt is a random string used to create additional protections against a variety of decryption methods.<br />
                For example, an attacker may take a list of common passwords and encrypt them to see if any match our encrypted passwords.
                By having a salt that's different then the default, the attacker can't see if the password matches any of the previous ones without having to do the same work all over again with the new salt.</dd>
